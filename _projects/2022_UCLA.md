When you first enter the website, you can choose either register or log in. Let’s assume the case of new user!
{%
	include image_with_caption.html
	url="/assets/projects/2022_UCLA/demo1.png"
	width="60%"
%}
Clicking ‘REGISTER’ button leads to registration page with some form to fill out.
{%
	include image_with_caption.html
	url="/assets/projects/2022_UCLA/demo2.png"
	width="60%"
%}
When finish registration, it automatically redirects to log in page. 
{%
	include image_with_caption.html
	url="/assets/projects/2022_UCLA/demo3.png"
	width="60%"
%}
There’s no recommendation because we just registered! To make our result available, we have to put some courses in QUARTER COURSE LOG tab.
{%
	include image_with_caption.html
	url="/assets/projects/2022_UCLA/demo4.png"
	width="60%"
%}
Let’s put some courses! If we choose department in the first form, it automatically scrape the classes in that department. It can be done by scrape.js 
{%
	include image_with_caption.html
	url="/assets/projects/2022_UCLA/demo5.png"
	width="60%"
%}
Let’s assume the screen below is my previous classes and ratings for each classes. This information is stored in MongoDB, under the corresponding user. We can see that user likes ECENGR M146, COMSCI 131, and COMSCI 260.
{%
	include image_with_caption.html
	url="/assets/projects/2022_UCLA/demo6.png"
	width="60%"
%}
According to the department selected, it immediately shows corresponding courses in COURSES form. We get information from UCLA to show the most relevant information to users.
{%
	include image_with_caption.html
	url="/assets/projects/2022_UCLA/department.png"
	width="60%"
%}

Then if we go back to our recommendations tab, the results appear. We can see 3 recommendation groups according to the classes the user likes.
It shows why this website gives certain recommendations with matching percentage.

	include image_with_caption.html
