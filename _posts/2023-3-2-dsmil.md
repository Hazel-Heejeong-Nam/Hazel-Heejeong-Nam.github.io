The paper discusses advancements in Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), focusing on a novel approach called Dual-stream MIL (DSMIL), which combines embedding-based and instance-based MIL.

Some key aspects of DSMIL include:

1. **SimCLR Pretraining**: 
   - Utilizes ResNet18 as the backbone model for pretraining on pathology images using SimCLR.
   - The paper notably compares the performance of feature extraction using four different methods: ImageNet pretrained weights, SimCLR pretrained weights, random initialization, and supervised learning. This comparison is done using a unified MIL aggregator to quantitatively assess their effectiveness. <br>


2. **Attention Mechanism**:

   - Traditional MIL approaches often use max pooling to aggregate from the instance level to the bag level. However, DSMIL points out that max pooling can lead to boundary shift problems and increase the false positive rate.
   - To address this, DSMIL introduces an attention mechanism that assigns weights to each instance, rather than selecting just one or a few instances. This approach, also used in methods like ABmil, is designed to highlight positive instances. While this has been somewhat validated and is effective in highlighting positive instances, it lacks a measurable distance, which diminishes its interpretability.
   - DSMIL addresses this issue by ranking instance embeddings to identify critical instances (those most likely to be positive). The embedding of these critical instances is then dot-producted with all instances in the bag to create a measurable score indicating the probability of being positive.

Overall, DSMIL represents a significant evolution in MIL, combining the strengths of embedding-based and instance-based approaches with an advanced attention mechanism for better interpretability and accuracy in instance selection.


Loss is calculated by averaging instance based loss and embedding based loss. Instance based probability is the probability of **critical instance** (same as max-pooling MIL), and embedding based probability can be obtained from  bag level probability after passing attention + MLP.
