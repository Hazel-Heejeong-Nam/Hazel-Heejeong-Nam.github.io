This method is an add-on approach for enhancing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models like DSMIL, DTFD, ABMIL with the incorporation of modules. The main idea is to address the presence of confounders, assuming that they can be extracted, using CNN backbones and shallow layer features.

Here's a summarized description of the method:

### Summary

#### 1. Start with the assumption that there are confounders in the data, and it is possible to extract them (let's say there are k of them).
- These confounders are related to the contextual information in pathological images.
- For example, consider a specific scenario where positive bags are stained pink, but negative bags are stained purple. They suggest that existing models might learn spurious correlations related to these stains.


#### 2. Utilize SCM, a framework for understanding causal relationships and identifying and mitigating spurious correlations.

The red part in the image represents what the author is concerned about (spurious correlations), while the blue part represents the desired situation (reliable causal inference).


#### 3. Confounder Extraction:

- Consider information across slides.
- Perform k-means clustering on the bag-level representations of the training set.
- Average the features within each cluster to obtain the confounders. These confounders capture the visual bias in the data.


#### 4. Causal Inference to Address Reducing Spurious Correlations (To transform the red part into the blue part in the SCM image)

- Execute a "do" operation, which essentially involves cutting the arrows (breaking causal links).

- It appears that "h" represents the bag representation with the confounders removed, and there's an attention mechanism involved in this process.

- Then concatenate bag level embedding as following :

The final expression of the do operation can be represented as
